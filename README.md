LIFO stands for "Last In, First Out," and FIFO stands for "First In, First Out." These terms are used to describe the order in which items are processed or accessed in data structures.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO principle. Imagine it like a stack of plates – the last plate you put on top is the first one you'll take off. It has two primary operations: push, which adds an element to the top of the stack, and pop, which removes the top element. Stacks are used in various scenarios, such as managing function calls in a program (the call stack), undo/redo functionality, and parsing expressions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A queue is another linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle. Think of it like a line of people waiting at a ticket counter – the person who arrived first gets served first. It has two primary operations: enqueue, which adds an element to the back of the queue, and dequeue, which removes an element from the front. Queues are commonly used in scenarios like managing tasks in a printer's queue, breadth-first search algorithms, and scheduling tasks in real-time systems.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Common implementations of stacks include using arrays or linked lists. For arrays, you can use the built-in list in Python. For linked lists, you can create a custom class where each node contains an item and a reference to the next node. Similarly, queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. You would enqueue at the back and dequeue from the front.

Some common use cases for stacks include:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.
Function Call Management: Stacks are used to manage the call hierarchy of functions in programming.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.
Expression Evaluation: Stacks can be used to evaluate arithmetic expressions and convert infix expressions to postfix or prefix.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.
Undo/Redo: Stacks are useful for implementing undo and redo functionality in applications.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
Backtracking: Stacks can help in backtracking algorithms, such as the depth-first search.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And common use cases for queues include:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.
Task Scheduling: Queues are used to manage tasks that need to be processed in a specific order.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.
Breadth-First Search: Queues are essential for BFS traversal in graphs.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Print Job Management: Queues are used in printer spooling systems to manage print jobs.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
Data Buffering: Queues can be used to buffer data in scenarios like asynchronous communication.
